Project for this week: Java ATM Machine Implementation

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to develop a simple ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system using Java programming language. The ATM system should enable users to perform essential banking operations such as withdrawal, deposit, balance inquiry, and purchasing airtime.

Requirements:

Account Class:

Implement an Account class representing a bank account with the following attributes:

- Account number
- PIN (Personal Identification Number)
- Balance

- Include methods in the Account class for:

- Depositing money
- Withdrawing money (ensure balance is sufficient)
- Checking account balance

ATM Class:

Create an ATM class to simulate ATM functionality with the following features:

- Validate user's PIN
- Display menu options:
- Withdrawal
- Deposit
- Balance Inquiry
- Buy Airtime
- Implement methods to handle user's selection and perform the corresponding operation

User Interface:

Design a simple text-based user interface to interact with the ATM system. 
The interface should:
- Prompt the user for account number and PIN
- Display the menu options
- Accept user input for menu selection and additional details required for each operation
- Display transaction results and errors

Buying Airtime:

- Include functionality to allow users to purchase airtime directly from their bank accounts using the ATM.

- Simulate the process within the ATM system.
